You are given with a N number, find the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to N, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.

Input description:
N a integer

Output Description:
find the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.

Sample Input:
6

Sample Output:
5

Explanation:
the binary representation of the numbers within the range:
0 -> 0
1 -> 1
2 -> 10
3 -> 11
4 -> 100
5 -> 101
6 -> 110
in this numbers 3,6 have consecutive ones in their binary representation, so the output is 7-2=5

9

Sample Output:
7
